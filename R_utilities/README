This directory contains useful R scripts for working with REGCAP outputs. 

'REGCAP_rco_viewer.R' 

This is a program that is run at the command line. User must have R 
installed and must have packages 'lubridate', 'zoo', 'xts' and 'data.table' installed. 
The file must be copied to the directory containing the .rco files. Navigate to the
chosen directory in the shell.

Usage at the shell:

# ##For daily averages
Rscript --vanilla REGCAP_rco_viewer.R days

# #For hourly averages
Rscript --vanilla REGCAP_rco_viewer.R hours

# #For monthly averages
Rscript --vanilla REGCAP_rco_viewer.R months

#Or combine them:
Rscript --vanilla REGCAP_rco_viewer.R months days hours

#To move all of the new files to an hourly or daily directory:
mv *.months [new_directory]
mv *.hours [new_directory]




'REGCAP_RC2_merge.R'

This is a program that will read in all .rc2 files in the supplied working directory.
They files are bound together by-row. Number of columns and column names must be identical. 
The file names are split by '_' and new columns are added with these filename values.
A merged file combining all .rc2 files together into one .csv file will be named the 
'<working directory>_RC2_merge.csv'.

Usage at the shell:

Rscript --vanilla REGCAP_rco_viewer.R <directory_name>

If you are not in the R_utilities directory, you must enter the path to the 'REGCAP_RC2_merge.R'
file. As in:

Rscript --vanilla <file_path>/REGCAP_rco_viewer.R <directory_name>





'REGCAP_Plotter'

This is a shiny application that allows users to upload local REGCAP data files (.rco, .hum,
.hours, .days, .months) and plot them using the dygraphs R package. Required packages are
library(xts); library(dygraphs); library(data.table); library(lubridate). Multiple files 
can be uploaded at once (NOT recommended for one-minute .rco or .hum files). There will
be some red ERROR text in the browser, which will go away once all selections are made.
The user selects the file, the date range and the columns to plot. An interactive figure is 
rendered in the browser. User can select a rolling average period in the bottom left corner
and can also select date/time ranges within the plotted data using sliders. With one-minute
data you must set the date range to be at most a few months. Full-year, one-minute bogs it 
down. Choose date range prior to selecting the data file to read, it's faster. This 
currently does not handle multiple variables at different scales, maybe will add 2nd y-axis
capability in the future.

User loads R and shiny and then issues these commands:
library(shiny)
setwd(<directory_path_containing_REGCAP_Plotter>)
runApp('REGCAP_Plotter')
